## Set Up Notes for Basic Express Server to Test

1. Create a .env file and SAMPLE.env, make sure the .env is in .gitignore file.

2. Make sure to set up directories for error handlers, middleware and tests to modularize code. Then touch the server.js, index.js, and any handler, middleware and test files needed.

3. Make sure to npm init and then npm i the dependencies needed for express, dotenv, jest, supertest. Then make sure "start": "node index.js" and "test": "jest --coverage", are in your scripts section of package.json.

4. Write your routes, tests, etc.
